Trying reads2snp pipeline for calling variants in SSW RNASeq dataset

General approach:


1. Convert SSW *sam files to *bam files:

* ```samtools view -@ 4 -uhSt exple.fasta exple.sam | samtools sort -@ 4 - exple```

* This will produce a sorted bam file “exple.bam” using 4 threads

--OR--

#!/bin/bash

cd /data/project_data/sam

# Fix mate pairs in bam files

for file in *.sam.bam

do

samtools view -@ 16 -bS "$file" >"$file.bam"
samtools fixmate "$file" >"$file.fixmate.bam"

done

##########

# Sort fixed bam files

for file in *.fixmate.bam

do

sambamba_v0.6.0 sort -m 6G -t 8 -p --tmpdir=/data/project_data/sam/tmp2/ "$file" "$file.fixmate.sorted.sambada"

done

##########
# Remove PCR dups

for file in *.fixmate.sorted.sambada

do 

sambamba_v0.6.0 markdup "$file" "$file.fixmate.sorted.mrkdup.bam"

done

# This is now ready to pass to reads2snps for mapping


2. Create a list of the bam files for input to reads2snp:

The bam list file must be a two-colon file including one line per analyzed individual, such as:

file1.bam   indiv1_name
file2.bam   indiv2_name

To make this list from the sam/ directory where the bam files are located:

ll *.bam >~/bamlist.txt
grep -o -P '\d\d\_.*bam' bamlist.txt >bamfiles.txt
grep -o -P '\d\d\_\d\-\d\d\_\w\_\d' bamfiles.txt >bamnames.txt
paste baminds.txt baminds2.txt > SSW_bamlist.txt

3. Call SNPs from bam files and reference assembly:

reads2snp -bam_list_file my_list.txt -bam_ref_file my_ref.fasta

We'll use our SSW de-novo assmebly from Trinity as the reference:

The assembly used for the mapping was /data/project_data/assembly/08-11-35-36_cl20_longest_orfs_gene.cds
