# GO_MWU uses continuous measure of significance (such as fold-change or -log(p-value) ) to identify GO categories that are significantly enriches with either up- or down-regulated genes. The advantage - no need to impose arbitrary significance cutoff.

# If the measure is binary (0 or 1) the script will perform a typical "GO enrichment" analysis based Fisher's exact test: it will show GO categories over-represented among the genes that have 1 as their measure. 

# On the plot, different fonts are used to indicate significance and color indicates enrichment with either up (red) or down (blue) regulated genes. No colors are shown for binary measure analysis.

# The tree on the plot is hierarchical clustering of GO categories based on shared genes. Categories with no branch length between them are subsets of each other.

# The fraction next to GO category name indicates the fracton of "good" genes in it; "good" genes being the ones exceeding the arbitrary absValue cutoff (option in gomwuPlot). For Fisher's based test, specify absValue=0.5. This value does not affect statistics and is used for plotting only.
